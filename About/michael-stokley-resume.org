* Profile
Software developer. I'm patient enough to take difficult projects seriously, and impatient enough to automate tedious, needlessly-manual projects. In my previous accounting position, I greatly exceeded expectations by teaching myself SQL and relational database theory in order to automate the vast majority of my data entry / data quality tasks (and avoid using a cumbersome GUI). I've been learning new languages and developer tools ever since.

* Technical Skills
** Proficient
Python, Django, Pyramid, Git, SQL, HTML/CSS, Unix systems, Shell Scripting, Org-mode, Scheme

** Familiar
JavaScript, jQuery, AWS Deployment, Heroku Deployment, Ansible, PostgreSQL, nginx, Gunicorn
