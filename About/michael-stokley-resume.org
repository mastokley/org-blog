* Profile
Software developer. I'm patient enough to take difficult projects seriously, and
impatient enough to automate tedious, needlessly-manual work. In my previous
accounting position, I greatly exceeded expectations by teaching myself SQL and
relational database theory in order to automate the vast majority of my data
entry / data quality tasks (and avoid using a cumbersome GUI). Since then, I
spent two years studying math, computer science, and statistics at North Seattle
College, attended Code Fellows' Python Development Intensive (taught by esteemed
pythonista Cris Ewing), and have independently studied the classic textbook /The
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs/. Recently I helped to
co-found a local big data / nlp startup, and have been working as a freelance
web developer.
