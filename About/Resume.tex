\subsection*{Profile}
\label{sec:orgheadline1}
Independent, self-motivated individual who places a high value on remaining engaged and challenged. As night shift data entry clerk, I involved myself in as many additional projects as possible, such as video review and 'closing misses'; as AR Specialist, I taught myself intermediate SQL, which permitted me to overhaul our billing and service history reports as well as automate or streamline many data entry / data quality processes. In both positions I greatly exceeded the expectations set by both the stated job description and by my predecessors. I look forward to meeting new challenges, growing as an employee, and contributing in a new position at your organization.
