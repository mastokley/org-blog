- 2 T vegetable oil
- 2 or 3 handfuls hot green chiles, such as serrano, jalapeno, or poblano
- 1 finely diced white onion
- salt

* Directions

1. Broil the tomatoes to blacken the surface somewhat
2. De-stem and char the green chiles, whole - you can do this as aggresively as you like
3. Saute the diced onion in the oil, gently, until translucent
4. Blend the garlic cloves with the green chiles until smooth
5. Combine all and simmer to reduce
6. Season to taste
